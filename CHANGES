[ Changes for 0.40 - Jan 20, 2006 ]

-- Changes by Nik Clayton

* Significant changes to the API.  It's not backwards compatible, but is
  now cleaner.
* One index now contains information about one repo.  It's now not possible
  to have one index contain information from multiple repos.
* Significant enhancements to the documentation.
* Require SVN::Log 0.03.  This gives us support for 'HEAD' in a revision
  specification.
* Indexing 'remembers' the last indexed revision.  The API exposes this,
  and bin/sli now supports 'LAST' in a revision specification.
* Significant changes to the bin/sli usage model.  It's now cleaner, but
  is not backwards compatible.

* Accept an alternate Analyzer in constructor [Mike Henson <mike at axl.net>].
* Return the relevance in the result hash [Mike Henson <mike at axl.net>].

[ Changes for 0.30 - Jun 14, 2004 ]

* Changed verbose output of sli program to look more like 'svn log' output.
* Moved log retrieval code into SVN::Log module, distributed separately, 
  because it turns out that people want to use it.  In the process fixed a 
  bug in the command line client parsing code that caused us to miss revs.
* Add a mechanism for forcing use of the svn command line client, even if 
  the subversion perl bindings are installed.
* Add tests that exercise the code that uses the svn command line client 
  to read logs from the repository.

[ Changes for 0.22 - May 29, 2004 ]

* Fix the 'sli' script so that it can actually create a new index.

[ Changes for 0.21 - May 27, 2004 ]

* Fix the log parsing code, it was refering to a nonexistant variable.
* Make tests chmod the repository's format file since recent versions of 
  svnadmin make it read-only.

[ Changes for 0.20 - Mar 23, 2004 ]

* Added CHANGES file.
* Minor documentation fixes.
* Correct capitalization of Plucene in dependencies.
* If we don't have the SVN perl bindings installed, use the command line 
  client to get log entries from the repository instead.
* Explicitly look for the svn and svnadmin executables in Build.PL, instead 
  of just failing horribly if they aren't found.

[ Changes for 0.1 - Feb 9, 2004 ]

* Initial release.
