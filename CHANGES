[ Changes for 0.21 - May 27, 2004 ]

* Fix the log parsing code, it was refering to a nonexistant variable.
* Make tests chmod the repository's format file since recent versions of 
  svnadmin make it read-only.

[ Changes for 0.20 - Mar 23, 2004 ]

* Added CHANGES file.
* Minor documentation fixes.
* Correct capitalization of Plucene in dependencies.
* If we don't have the SVN perl bindings installed, use the command line 
  client to get log entries from the repository instead.
* Explicitly look for the svn and svnadmin executables in Build.PL, instead 
  of just failing horribly if they aren't found.

[ Changes for 0.1 - Feb 9, 2004 ]

* Initial release.
