[ Changes for 0.30 - Jun 11, 2004 ]

* Changed verbose output of sli program to look more like 'svn log' output.
* Moved log retrieval code into SVN::Log module, distributed separately, 
  because it turns out that people want to use it.  In the process fixed a 
  bug in the command line client parsing code that caused us to miss revs.
* Add a mechanism for forcing use of the svn command line client, even if 
  the subversion perl bindings are installed.
* Add tests that exercise the code that uses the svn command line client 
  to read logs from the repository.

[ Changes for 0.22 - May 29, 2004 ]

* Fix the 'sli' script so that it can actually create a new index.

[ Changes for 0.21 - May 27, 2004 ]

* Fix the log parsing code, it was refering to a nonexistant variable.
* Make tests chmod the repository's format file since recent versions of 
  svnadmin make it read-only.

[ Changes for 0.20 - Mar 23, 2004 ]

* Added CHANGES file.
* Minor documentation fixes.
* Correct capitalization of Plucene in dependencies.
* If we don't have the SVN perl bindings installed, use the command line 
  client to get log entries from the repository instead.
* Explicitly look for the svn and svnadmin executables in Build.PL, instead 
  of just failing horribly if they aren't found.

[ Changes for 0.1 - Feb 9, 2004 ]

* Initial release.
