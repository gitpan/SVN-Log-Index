NAME
    SVN::Log::Index - Index and search over Subversion commit logs.

SYNOPSIS
      my $index = SVN::Log::Index->new ('/path/to/index');

      $index->add ('svn://host/repos', 1);

      my $results = $index->search ('query');

DESCRIPTION
    SVN::Log::Index builds a Plucene index of commit logs from any number of
    Subversion repositories and allows you to do arbitrary full text
    searches over them.

METHODS
  new
      my $index = SVN::Log::Index->new ('/path/to/index', create => $create);

    Create a new index or an object to manage an existing index.

    The first argument is the path to the index on disk, and all remaining
    arguments are used to create an args hash.

    If the args hash's 'create' entry is true a new index will be created,
    otherwise an existing index will be opened.

  add
      $index->add ('svn://host/path/to/repos', $start_rev, $end_rev);

    Add one or more log messages to the index. If a second revision is not
    specified, the revision passed will be added to the index, otherwise the
    range of revisions from $start_rev to $end_rev will be added.

  search
      my $hits = $index->search ($query);

    Search for $query (which is parsed into a Plucene::Search::Query object
    by the Lucene::QueryParser module) in $index and return a reference to
    an array of hash references. Each hash reference points to a hash where
    the key is the field name and the value is the field value for all the
    fields associated with the hit.
