NAME
    SVN::Log::Index - Index and search over Subversion commit logs.

SYNOPSIS
      my $index = SVN::Log::Index->new({ index_path => '/path/to/index' });

      if($creating) {    # Create from scratch if necessary
        $index->create({ repo_url => 'url://for/repo' });
      }

      $index->open();    # And then open it

      # Now add revisions from the repo to the index
      $index->add({ start_rev => $start_rev,
                    end_rev   => $end_rev);

      # And query the index
      my $results = $index->search('query');

DESCRIPTION
    SVN::Log::Index builds a KinoSearch index of commit logs from a
    Subversion repository and allows you to do arbitrary full text searches
    over it.

METHODS
  new
      my $index = SVN::Log::Index->new({
          index_path => '/path/to/index'
      });

    Create a new index object.

    The single argument is a hash ref. Currently only one key is valid.

    index_path
        The path that contains (or will contain) the index files.

    This method prepares the object for use, but does not make any changes
    on disk.

  create
      $index->create({
          repo_url       => 'url://for/repo',
          analyzer_class => 'KinoSearch::Analysis::PolyAnalyzer',
          analyzer_opts  => [ language => 'en' ],
          overwrite      => 0, # Optional
      });

    This method creates a new index, in the "index_path" given when the
    object was created.

    The single argument is a hash ref, with the following possible keys.

    repo_url
        The URL for the Subversion repository that is going to be indexed.

    analyzer_class
        A string giving the name of the class that will analyse log message
        text and tokenise it. This should derive from the
        KinoSearch::Analysis::Analyzer class. SVN::Log::Index will call this
        class' "new()" method.

        Once an analyzer class has been chosen for an index it can not be
        changed without deleting the index and creating it afresh.

        The default value is "KinoSearch::Analysis::PolyAnalyzer".

    analyzer_opts
        A list of options to be passed, as is, to the constructor for the
        "analyzer_class" object.

    overwrite
        A boolean indicating whether or not a pre-existing index_path should
        be overwritten.

        Given this sequence;

          my $index = SVN::Log::Index->new({index_path => '/path'});
          $index->create({repo_url => 'url://for/repo'});

        The call to "create()" will fail if "/path" already exists.

        If "overwrite" is set to a true value then "/path" will be cleared.

        The default is false.

    After creation the index directory will exist on disk, and a
    configuration file containing the create()-time parameters will be
    created in the index directory.

    Newly created indexes must still be opened.

  open
      $index->open();

    Opens the index, in preparation for adding or removing entries.

  add
      $index->add ({
          start_rev      => $start_rev,  # number, or 'HEAD'
          end_rev        => $end_rev,    # number, or 'HEAD'
      });

    Add one or more log messages to the index.

    The single argument is a hash ref, with the following possible keys.

    start_rev
        The first revision to add to the index. May be given as "HEAD" to
        mean the repository's most recent (youngest) revision.

        This key is mandatory.

    end_rev
        The last revision to add to the index. May be given as "HEAD" to
        mean the repository's most recent (youngest) revision.

        This key is optional. If not included then only the revision
        specified by "start_rev" will be indexed.

    Revisions from "start_rev" to "end_rev" are added inclusive. "start_rev"
    and "end_rev" may be given in ascending or descending order. Either:

      $index->add({ start_rev => 1, end_rev => 10 });

    or

      $index->add({ start_rev => 10, end_rev => 1 });

    In both cases, revisons are indexed in ascending order, so revision 1,
    followed by revision 2, and so on, up to revision 10.

  get_last_indexed_rev
      my $rev = $index->get_last_indexed_rev();

    Returns the revision number that was most recently added to the index.

    Most useful in repeated calls to "add()".

      # Loop forever.  Every five minutes wake up, and add all newly
      # committed revisions to the index.
      while(1) {
        sleep 300;
        $index->add({ start_rev => $index->get_last_indexed_rev() + 1,
                      end_rev   => 'HEAD' });
      }

    The last indexed revision number is saved as a property of the index.

  search
      my $hits = $index->search($query);

    Search for $query and returns a KinoSearch::Search::Hits object which
    contains the result.

QUERY SYNTAX
    This module supports the Lucene query syntax, described in detail at
    <http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/queryparsersyntax.html>. A brief
    overview follows.

    *   A query consists of one or more terms, joined with boolean
        operators.

    *   A term is either a single word, or two or more words, enclosed in
        double quotes. So

          foo bar baz

        is a different query from

          "foo bar" baz

        The first searches for any of "foo", "bar", or "baz", the second
        searches for any of "foo bar", or "baz".

    *   By default, multiple terms in a query are OR'd together. You may
        also use "AND", or "NOT" between terms.

          foo AND bar
          foo NOT bar

        Use "+" before a term to indicate that it must appear, and "-"
        before a term to indicate that it must not appear.

          foo +bar
          -foo bar

    *   Use parantheses to control the ordering.

          (foo OR bar) AND baz

    *   Searches are conducted in *fields*. The default field to search is
        the log message. Other fields are indicated by placing the field
        name before the term, separating them both with a ":".

        Available fields are:

        revision
        author
        date
        paths

        For example, to find all commit messages where "nik" was the
        committer, that contained the string "foo bar":

          author:nik AND "foo bar"

DIAGNOSTICS
    Any of these methods may fail. If they do, they throw an
    Exception::Class subclass representing the error, trappable with "eval".
    Uncaught exceptions will cause the client application to "die".

  SVN::Log::Index::X::Args
    Represents an error that occurs if the parameters given to any of the
    methods are wrong. This might be because there are too few or too many
    parameters, or that the types of those parameters are wrong.

    The text of the error can be retrieved with the "error()" method.

  SVN::Log::Index::X::Fault
    Represents any other error.

  Example
      my $e;
      eval { $index->search('query string'); };

      if($e = SVN::Log::Index::X::Fault->caught()) {
          print "An error occured: ", $e->string(), "\n";
      } elsif ($e = Exception::Class->caught()) {
          # Something else failed, rethrow the error
          ref $e ? $e->rethrow() : die $e;
      }
