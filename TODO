* a 'sync' command that goes out and gets all the revs for a repos you don't 
  have in your index yet.  this means keeping track of what revs we have and 
  what ones we don't have yet.

* a way to replace a given rev's entry in the index, for use when someone does 
  a propchange on svn:log for the rev.

* avoid having multiple entries in the index for a given log entry, probably 
  means storing the uuid rather than the url and searching for uuid/rev combos 
  before adding to the index.  need to see how to make that fast...

* have tests verify that the svn and svnadmin binaries are installed before 
  trying to use them.

* sli should take symbolic revision specifications in addition to numeric ones
